ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:

1) Probability of each of the three outcomes: Two Heads- 0.25, Head and Tail- 0.25, Two Tails- 0.25
    ii) Head and Tail probability is higher because it has a higher chance of becoming an outcome when 2 seperate coins
        are flipped

2) Trials to get results within 1% of probabilities: After run (550):
                                                     Number of Trials [exp:2440]: 2440
                                                     Two-head tosses: 587
                                                     Two-tail tosses: 618
                                                     One-head one-tail tosses: 1235

   Probabilities: One-head one-tail tosses- 0.506, Two-head tosses- 0.241, Two-tail tosses: 0.253

3) Number of trials before it crashes with an overflow error:
   Largest value when it still worked correctly: 999999999
   Largest value that caused it to overflow: 1000000000
