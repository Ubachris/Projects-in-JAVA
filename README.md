Projects in Java done in my Introduction to programming class at school

The projects include:

A bulgarian solitaire simulated game- 
  The user any number of either one or multiple stack of cards where the sum is less than 45. Then the program simulates a game of bulgarian solitaire, and ends up with 9 stacks of cards starting from 1 in the first stack and consecutively increasing till the ninth stack with 9 cards
  
Coin Toss simulator-
    This program simulates the randomness of a coin toss. The user inputs a specific number of tosses to simulate, and the program simulates a coin toss that specific number of times, and then generates a bar graph at the end that portrays the results
    
Maze-
  This program is a maze viewer that takes an input file representing a maze, with its walls and spaces indicated by 1's and 0's. The input is then turned into an actual visual representation of a maze with entry points and exit points. The program then uses the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm from the starting point to find an exit. If it finds one, it highllights the path it took form start to finish, and is there isn't one, it lets the user know there wasn't any path fpund 
  
Word Finder-
  This programm immitates a game of scrabble. It takes a word from the user, finds its anagrams, and scores it according to the scrabble dictionary point scoring system
